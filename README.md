**Sharoma Indigenous Corporation**

**Overview**
-
This project is part of my university coursework, where I developed a mobile and web application for Sharoma Indigenous Corporation (SHIC), a fully Aboriginal-owned non-profit organisation also operating as the Sport, Culture, and Leadership Academy (SCALA). The main goal of the app is to improve data integration, streamline registrations, and provide easier access to programs and information for both Indigenous and commercial participants.

The app was developed using Mendix, a low-code platform, which allowed rapid development, easy adjustments, and scalable functionality without extensive coding. Using Mendix, I was able to design a user-friendly interface and implement features that support SHIC’s operational goals.

Throughout the project, I held weekly meetings with SHIC to gather feedback, adjust content, and ensure that the app meets the needs of its users. This collaborative approach allowed for the creation of a practical and accessible solution that aligns with the organisation’s objectives.
